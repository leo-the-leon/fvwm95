# fvwm95
---
This is a fork of fvwm95 meant to be compilable on and play nice with newer Unix-like operating systems.

It is based off the code from the source package in Debian Sarge, slightly modified so that it compiles without errors on modern OSes, and with a more sane configuration to adapt to modern day needs.
